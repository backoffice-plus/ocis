Feature: make webdav request with special urls
  As a user
  I want to make webdav request with special urls
  So that I can make sure that they work

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"


  Scenario: send DELETE requests to webDav endpoints with 2 slashes
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "DELETE" using password "%regular%" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                            |
      | //remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |
      | //remote.php//dav/files/%username%/textfile1.txt    |
      | /remote.php//dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
      | /remote.php//webdav/PARENT                          |
      | //remote.php/dav//files/%username%//FOLDER          |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on each endpoint should be "200,200,204,204,200" on oCIS or "204,204,204,204,204" on reva
